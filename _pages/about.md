I'm Rigvita Sharma, Junior Year B.E.(Hons.) Computer Science student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani(BITS Pilani). 
Through my coursework and projects, I have learned various aspects of computer science. My course and personnal projects gave me an oppurtunity to apply them in different fields with real life utility ranging from seismology to neuroscience to arts. I have also volunteered for teaching computer skills to villagers. 

Currently, I am serving as the Chair for BITS ACMW Chapter for current academic year. We mentor girls on campus to have a career in computer science by engaging them in workshops and team projects.
