I'm Rigvita Sharma, Final Year B.E.(Hons.) Computer Science student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani(BITS Pilani). 

I love exploring new things through my coursework and projects. This has helped me to learn various aspects of computer science, giving me opportunity to touch different fields with my code ranging from seismology to neuroscience to arts. 

Other than that, I have also spent my time volunteering in Pilani to teach computer skills to villagers. I have also served as the Chair for BITS ACMW Chapter for academic year 2018-19. Where I mentored girls on campus to have a career in computer science by engaging them in workshops and team projects.
